## <a name="About"></a>About

This is a patch//device built in Max/MSP for spacious, ever-changing delays on a stereo signal. Up to 12 delay voices read from one shared 12-second recording of the input. Every voice keeps jumping ("skipping") to a new random delay time within your chosen range, crossfading each jump so it never clicks, and each voice has its own filter, amplitude and panning movement at randomly chosen speeds. The result is a cloud of echoes that keeps rearranging itself around what you play.

### Delay

**Voices:** The number of active delay voices, between 1 and 12. The default is 4. At least one voice is always on. The more voices, the denser the texture and the higher the CPU use. Voices fade in and out when the number changes.

**Dry/Wet:** The balance between the dry signal and the delays, between 0 and 100 %. The default is 100 (delays only). The mix is equal-power, so the level stays even across the range.

**Delay 1:** One end of the range of delay times, in ms, between 0 and 10000. The default is 1000 ms. Each time a voice skips, it picks a random delay time between "Delay 1" and "Delay 2". Either one can be the larger.

**Delay 2:** The other end of the range of delay times, in ms, between 0 and 10000. The default is 5000 ms.

**Repeats:** How many echoes a voice lets you hear at one delay time before it skips to the next, between 1 and 4. The default is 2. Whole numbers keep the skips on the rhythm of the echoes; values in between land between echoes.

**Crossfade (XFade):** How long each skip takes to crossfade from the old delay time to the new one, in ms, between 15 and 2000. The default is 1000 ms. It is also how long voices take to fade in and out, and how long the filter, amp and pan speeds take to glide to new values.

**Feedback (Fdbk):** Feeds the delayed sound back into the recording, between 0 and 0.95. The default is 0. It is scaled by the number of active voices, so the same setting behaves the same with 1 voice or 12, and it is soft-limited so it never runs away.

**Freeze:** Stops recording and keeps every voice skipping around only the last moments before you pressed it -- the window set by the longest Delay time at that moment (at least 100 ms). No older material and no silent gaps come back. Freezing and releasing are crossfaded, and so is the point where the frozen window loops. The default is off (Live).

### Filter, Amp and Pan

Each of these three sections moves on its own, in every voice, driven by a low-frequency oscillator (LFO). Each voice picks a new random LFO speed between "Rate 1" and "Rate 2" from time to time (timed from the delay range, the Repeats setting and the Crossfade), so every voice moves differently.

**Rate 1 / Rate 2:** The range of LFO speeds, in Hz, between 0.001 and 20. The defaults are 0.05 and 0.5 Hz. Either one can be the larger.

**Shape:** The LFO shape: Sine, Saw Up, Tri, Saw Down, Square, S&H (a new random value each cycle) or Curved Random (glides smoothly between random values). The default is Sine.

**Bypass:** Turns the section off (Bypassed) or on (Active), with a short crossfade. A bypassed section also stops computing, saving CPU. The default is Active.

**Filter -- Freq A / Freq B:** The two ends of the filter sweep, in Hz, between 20 and 20000. The defaults are 300 and 4000 Hz. The sweep moves in octaves, so it sounds even from low to high.

**Filter -- Reso:** The filter resonance, between 0 and 1. The default is 0.3. The level is automatically compensated so high resonance doesn't jump in volume.

**Filter -- LP / BP:** Lowpass or bandpass filter. The default is LP. Switching is crossfaded. Sudden cutoff jumps (Square, Saw, S&H) are also crossfaded so they switch cleanly without a tick.

**Amp -- Depth:** How far the volume dips, between 0 and 1. The default is 0.7. The movement is in decibels (down to -40 dB at full depth), so swells and tremolo sound even to the ear.

**Pan -- Range:** How far from the center the voices travel, between 0 and 1. The default is 0.5. Panning is constant-power and nothing is lost at the edges: both channels are panned and folded together.
